Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Different Basis Sets
======================================================

Section 1: Introduction to Density Functional Theory (DFT)
--------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we'll introduce you to the fundamental principles of Density Functional Theory (DFT), a widely used approach in computational materials science and quantum chemistry.

1. What is Density Functional Theory (DFT)?
   - DFT basics: Electronic density, total energy, and the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem.
   - Kohn-Sham approach: Solving the many-body Schr√∂dinger equation using fictitious non-interacting electrons.

   .. math::

      \hat{H}_{KS}\psi_i = \left(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + V_{ext} + V_{H}[\rho] + V_{XC}[\rho]\right)\psi_i = \epsilon_i\psi_i

   In the Kohn-Sham approach, we map the interacting system to an auxiliary non-interacting system of electrons with effective potentials.

2. The Kohn-Sham Equations
   - Kohn-Sham equations derivation.
   - Self-consistent field (SCF) method for finding the electronic structure.

   .. math::

      V_{eff}[\rho](r) = V_{ext}(r) + \int\frac{\rho(r')}{|r - r'|}dr' + \frac{\delta E_{XC}}{\delta\rho(r)}

   The Kohn-Sham equations represent a set of equations where the electron wavefunctions and energies are obtained self-consistently to minimize the total energy of the system.

Section 2: Exchange-Correlation Functionals in DFT
-------------------------------------------------

In this section, we'll focus on exchange-correlation functionals, a crucial aspect of DFT that accounts for electron-electron interactions.

1. Introduction to Exchange-Correlation Functionals
   - The role of exchange and correlation in DFT.
   - Local Density Approximation (LDA) and Generalized Gradient Approximation (GGA).

   .. math::

      E_{XC}^{LDA}[\rho] = \int \epsilon_{XC}^{LDA}[\rho](r) \rho(r) dr
      E_{XC}^{GGA}[\rho] = \int \epsilon_{XC}^{GGA}[\rho](r) \rho(r) dr

   Exchange-correlation functionals capture the quantum mechanical exchange and correlation effects of electrons, essential for an accurate description of the electronic system.

2. Beyond LDA and GGA
   - Meta-GGA and hybrid functionals.
   - Overview of hybrid functionals like B3LYP and PBE0.

   .. math::

      E_{XC}^{meta-GGA}[\rho] = \int \epsilon_{XC}^{meta-GGA}[\rho](r) \rho(r) dr
      E_{XC}^{hybrid}[\rho] = (1 - \alpha)E_{XC}^{GGA}[\rho] + \alpha E_{XC}^{HF}[\rho]

   Beyond LDA and GGA, meta-GGA and hybrid functionals offer improved accuracy for specific systems, combining the advantages of both local and non-local functionals.

Section 3: Solving Kohn-Sham Equations with Different Basis Sets
---------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we'll explore different basis sets used to solve the Kohn-Sham equations in Density Functional Theory.

1. Plane Wave Basis Set
   - Introduction to the plane wave basis set.
   - Solving Kohn-Sham equations using plane waves.
   - Codes that use plane wave basis sets: Quantum ESPRESSO, VASP.

   Plane wave basis sets provide an efficient representation of electronic wavefunctions in periodic systems, making them well-suited for solid-state simulations.

2. Finite Basis Sets
   - Introduction to finite basis sets (e.g., Gaussian basis sets).
   - Solving Kohn-Sham equations using finite basis sets.
   - Codes that use finite basis sets: NWChem, Gaussian.

   Finite basis sets are widely used in quantum chemistry calculations for molecular systems, offering flexibility and accuracy for localized electronic states.

3. Pseudopotentials and Basis Set Quality
   - Pseudopotentials and their role in reducing the computational cost.
   - Evaluating the quality of basis sets for accuracy and efficiency.

   Pseudopotentials approximate the effect of core electrons, reducing the computational burden while maintaining accuracy for valence electrons.
